COVID-19 Data Analysis and Preprocessing Project
Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and preprocessing a COVID-19 dataset . The dataset includes various attributes, such as patient information and outcomes. The project is divided into two key experiments:
Proposed methodologies includes:
Experiment 1: Feature selection and modeling using baseline machine learning models.
Experiment 2: Advanced modeling with feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning.

Features:
Data loading and initial exploration.
Statistical summary of the dataset.
Identification and handling of missing values.
Feature selection for dimensionality reduction.
Implementation of baseline and advanced machine learning models.
Hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is named Covid Data.csv, containing anonymized COVID-19 patient data, including:
Patient demographics
Medical test results
Outcomes related to COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment

Project Structure
The notebook contains the following sections:
Libraries and Dependencies: Importing required Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
Loading the Dataset: Reading the data from the CSV file.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Viewing the first few rows and dataset structure.
Descriptive statistics.
Analysis of unique values and distributions.

Experiments:
Experiment 1:
Feature selection using statistical and algorithmic approaches.
Implementation of baseline machine learning models such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Experiment 2:
Feature selection with advanced techniques.
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search.
